/*!
 * \brief Qt undo command for deleting items
 *
 * Handles deletion of single or multiple items by storing XML snapshots.
 * Uses built-in batching (QList<DeletedItemInfo>) for efficiency - delete
 * operations naturally come as sets with ordering constraints.
 *
 * Key design decisions:
 * - Stores full item hierarchy in XML (children are included automatically)
 * - Handles ID remapping when items are restored (may get new IDs)
 * - Nullifies mpHost before deletion to prevent unregistration issues
 * - Sorts items for correct restoration order (parents before children)
