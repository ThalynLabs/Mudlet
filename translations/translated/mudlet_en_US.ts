        <extracomment>This text uses non-breaking spaces (as &apos;%1&apos;s, as Qt Creator cannot handle them literally in raw strings) and a non-breaking hyphen which are used to prevent the line being split at some places it might otherwise be; when translating please consider at which points the text may be divided to fit onto more than one line. This text is for when TWO or MORE rooms are selected; %1 is the room number for which %2-%4 are the x,y and z coordinates of the room nearest the middle of the selection. This room has the yellow cross-hairs. %n is the count of rooms selected and will ALWAYS be greater than 1 in this situation. It is provided so that non-English translations can select required plural forms as needed.</extracomment>
